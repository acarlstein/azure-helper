# azure-helper README

The purpose of the Azure Helper is to provide a hand when dealing with resources created in Azure.

Depending of the projects, multiple resources and resources groups may be created.
This means that developers must access the site or use command lines 
(such as Azure Cli or PowerShell), in order to obtain the names of such resources and groups.

Azure Helper will provide suggestions as you type that can help you to save time.

### Images

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

### Extension

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: enable/disable this extension
* `myExtension.thing`: set to `blah` to do something
